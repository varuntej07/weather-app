A basic weather application built with the MERN stack, allowing users to:

1. Enter a location to get current weather.
2. View a 5-day forecast.
3. Optionally use their browserâ€™s Geolocation to fetch local weather.

Usage:
1. clone repository
   git clone https://github.com/varuntej07/weather-app/

2. change directory
   cd weather-app
   
3. Install dependencies
   npm install
   
4. open client directory
   cd weather
   npm start
   This will start the web application on port 3000 by default (check: https//localhost:3000)
   
5. open server directory in another terminal
   cd backend
   npm run
   This will start the server on port 5000 by default and key play with the location like: http://localhost:5000/weather?location=Seattle

Future Enhancements
- Database CRUD operations
- Additional APIs (Maps, YouTube)
